   - Visualizing uncertainty across optimistic/realistic/pessimistic axes

3. **Key Milestones**

   - Observation points to catch early signs of change

4. **News Sources**
   - Evidence-based predictions for reliability
   - Multiple sources required to avoid confirmation bias

   - Detailed expansion as needed for cost efficiency
